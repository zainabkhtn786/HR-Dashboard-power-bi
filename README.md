## 4. Scope:
a. Overall employee count, attrition rate, and active employees

b. Job satisfaction ratings by department

c. Attrition analysis by age group, gender, and education field

d. Department-wise and job role-wise attrition trends

e Interactive visualizations for real-time HR monitoring


## 5. Data Sources

#### Primary Data: HR dataset (Excel file) containing employee details such as job roles, education, department, attrition status, and satisfaction ratings.

#### Secondary Data: Not applicable in this project.


## 6. Methodology
